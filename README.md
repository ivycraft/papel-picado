# Papel Picado Designs for PDX Hackerspace

These are some files I used to laser cut paper flags for special events at our hackerspace. They were drawn with pen and paper first, then scanned and traced using inkscape. Some of the lines are wavy because they were hand drawn. Each design has a hackerspace theme, inspired by cool projects and interests.  

I wanted to share this with the rest of the hackerspace community. I hope you like it!

### Designs

  * hack the planet- referencing [this movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film) "Hackers")
  * nyan cat- We have a giant [nyan cat mural](images/nyan-cat-mural.jpg?raw=true "mural") on the side of our building
  * bomb truck- [this truck](bomb-truck.jpg?raw=true "truck") is a member project used during rocket launches and ham radio drills
  * key- lots of interest in physical and digital security at the hackerspace
  * LEDs- blinky things FTW
  * brain- learning from the community
  * computer- retro computing is best computing
  
If you want to see these in person, please do! These are displayed at [our hackerspace](http://pdxhackerspace.org "PDX Hackerspace"). There are lots of events happening all the time which are free and open to the general public.
